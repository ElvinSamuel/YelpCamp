# YelpCamp - Meet Explorers

## What is YelpCamp?
Similar to Yelp itself, YelpCamp is a review site for campgrounds where campers can chat. Simple, right?

# The Build
## NodeJS 
The entire backend of this site is in NodeJS, modules and all. This was my biggest project in the framework, using everything I knew and learned to construct a fully-functional and layered website.

## MongoDb
The database is built in Mongo via Mongoose. Campsites, camper data, everything is added via that schema and displayed using Mongoose in conjuction with Express.

## Bootstrap
The quickest way for me to get an MVP was to use bootstrap. The pre-built objects made the front-end easy and intuitive.

## Express
Like the "mac" to Node's "cheese", express was critical for reconfiguring and rerouting my pages. This keeps the code files tidy and easy to debug.

## EJS
I learned more about React later, but EJS was the first view framework I learned. It's quick and intuitive -- not as robust as React but great for this project.
